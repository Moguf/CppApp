1. Use constructors to establish invariants.
2. Use constructor/destrutor pairs to simplify resource managment.
3. Avoid "naked" new and delete.
4. Use containers and algorithms rather than built-in arrays and ad hoc code.
5. Prefer standard-library facilities to locally developed code.
6. Use exceptions, rather than error codes, to report errors that cannot be handled locally.
7. Use move smantics to avoid copying large object.
8. Use unique_ptr to reference objects of polymorphic type.
9. Use shared_ptr to reference shared objects, that is, objects without a single owner that is responsible for their destruction.
10. Use templates to maintain static type safety (eliminate casts) and avoid unnecessary use of class hierarchies.
